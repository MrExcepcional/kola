# Warning 
## Linkedin does not allow use of robots, crawlers or scripts in their web site. Don't use it or you may be banned from the platform. Ask me how I now this... well I didnt read the user agreement before creating this.

### kola
Automatic crawler to explore, filter and apply jobs with custom criteria not available in Linkedin. Deprecated.

Before my Linkedin account was retricted, functionality did as follow: opens browser, navigates to job search in Linkedin and shows me the next job description just hiting "enter" skiping the ones that I already applied.

Functionality untested in real website: detection and classification of job description language. If language wasn't in my taget language would also skip the job.
